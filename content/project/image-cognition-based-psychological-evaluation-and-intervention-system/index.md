We built the first psychological image database based on MMPI, and designed a set of psychological paradigms based on emotional image cognition. We put forward an objective and rapid psychological characteristic extraction method based on image cognition, which changed the traditional scale-based psychological evaluation model,. This system won the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Innovation Award (First Class) and Silver Award of Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions.
