As data-driven machine learning methods are difficult to achieve accurate recognition under dynamic complex scenes, we made a breakthrough based on the psychologically stable prior of cognitive subjects, put forward the thought of Subject-Data Bidirectional Driven Learning, and established the three-dimensional image Gestalt Cognitive Computing Theory. The proposed theory significantly improved the accuracy under dynamic complex scene.
